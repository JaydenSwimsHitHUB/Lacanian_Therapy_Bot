    - Hi there.
    - How are you?
    - Hello!
    - I was walking down the road when I saw a cow.
    - I know it's wrong, but I still want it.
    - It all seems pointless, yet I try.
    - I feel like giving up but something stops me.
    - The truth is a lie.
    - Pain and pleasure are the same.
    - The sky is not blue but red.
    - I question my own question.
    - Nothing matters, although everything matters.
    - I really don't want to tell my mother I love her.
    - I can't say I love her.
    - I feel uncomfortable saying I love my mom.
    - Why do I feel blocked when I try to express love?
    - I feel something but I can't say it.
    - I want to love her, but I resist.
    - Still, I try.
    - I hate that I want this.
    - It makes no sense.
    - I want it, even if it's wrong.
    - Is it wrong to want this?
    - I don't know
    - Maybe...
    - What do you think?
    - It just keeps happening.
    - I said it but I didn’t mean it.
    - Say something! 
    - I hate you.
    - I want you to speak!
